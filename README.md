🎬 CineFlix — Movie Streaming UI

Live Demo: 👉 https://cine-flix-pi.vercel.app/

CineFlix is a Netflix-inspired movie streaming frontend application built to simulate how a real OTT platform behaves for different users and profiles.
The focus of this project is UI behavior, user experience, and realistic product logic, not just fetching movies.

This project was built from scratch to practice real-world frontend architecture, profile handling, and state-driven UI flows.

✨ What makes this project different?

This is not a basic movie listing app.

CineFlix includes:

Multiple user profiles (Adult & Kids)

Profile-specific data (watch later, activity, continue watching)

Kids-safe content filtering

Dynamic hero section with animations

Mobile-first responsive behavior

Netflix-style UI interactions

Every profile behaves like a separate user, just like a real streaming platform.
